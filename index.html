          In what is now being referred to as  <strong>“The Greatest Hoax of the Century” </strong>, fifth-year Hogwarts student
           <strong>Harry Potter </strong>continues to insist that <strong>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named </strong>has returned.
            Despite multiple Ministry statements assuring the wizarding public that <strong>“There is Nothing!” </strong> to fear.

          The Ministry of Magic has issued its strongest denial to date, reaffirming that 
          the Wizarding World remains safe and stable. Minister Cornelius Fudge addressed the press this morning, 
          stating: "Rumors, no matter how loudly repeated, do not make reality. We urge the public to place their 
          trust in official sources, not in the fevered imagination of a fame-hungry schoolboy." 
          The statement was backed by a full Wizengamot declaration ensuring “no credible threat” exists to 
          the security of the magical community.

          What should have been a night of celebration at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry turned into 
          <strong>tragedy and chaos</strong>, as <strong>Cedric Diggory</strong>, Hogwarts champion and beloved student, was found <strong>dead</strong> shortly after 
          the conclusion of the Triwizard Tournament's final task.
          <p class="details goudos">
          But even as the school reels from the devastating loss, controversy has ignited over <strong> Potter's shocking claim</strong>:

          Potter, already notorious for his past encounters with You-Know-Who, insists that the Dark Lord <strong>“is back, 
          alive and gathering followers.”</strong> The statement has sent shockwaves through the wizarding community, but <strong>Ministry 
          officials have categorically denied the allegations, calling them “unsubstantiated, hysterical, and dangerous.”</strong>
